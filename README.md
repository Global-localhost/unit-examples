# unitwp
NGINX Unit PHP Wordpress buildstack. This will create a docker container image, running wordpress and expose it on port 8080. The production ready container image does not include a database. If you need a database along with your WP installation, check out the dev folder.


## Before you start

Get the WPCoode:
In my example I am using php composer to download the latest version of WP. The composer.json will create a folder named `wordpress` with the WP code-base in it.

run
````shell script
composer install
````

Feel free to adjust this.
In case your WP directory is different from `wordpress` adjust the Dockerfile:

YOURWPHOME = WP code-base directory

````shell script
FROM nginx/unit:1.18.0-php7.3
MAINTAINER tippexs
RUN mkdir /var/apphome/ && groupadd -r wordpress && useradd --no-log-init -r -g wordpress wordpress && \
    chown -R wordpress:wordpress /var/apphome/ && \
    apt-get update && apt-get install --no-install-recommends --no-install-suggests -y php7.3-mysql php7.3-gd
# Add WP CLI

COPY YOURWPHOME /var/apphome
RUN chown -R wordpress:wordpress /var/apphome/
COPY .unit.conf.json /docker-entrypoint.d/.unit.conf.json
CMD ["unitd", "--no-daemon", "--control", "unix:/var/run/control.unit.sock"]
````


Adjust build.sh script to your needs:

YOURIMAGETAG = Your local image tag name
REMOTEIMAGETAG = The Image tag including the target docker registry


### Docker registry security 
NOTE: Before pushing to a private docker registry or to docker hub, you need to be logged-in.

````shell script
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -ex
build_container() {
  docker build -t YOURIMAGETAG --no-cache .
}

containerize() {
  echo "Building Container Image"
  build_container
  docker tag YOURIMAGETAG:latest REMOTEIMAGETAG:latest
  echo "Pushing... "
  docker push REMOTEIMAGETAG:latest
}

case $1 in
"push")
  echo "Building and Pushing to Registry ..."
  containerize
  ;;
esac
````

## Development Environment
NGINX Unit is great for creating a local development environment. E.g it's simple to change the PHP Version in use just by calling the UNIT API.

Anything you need is in the dev folder. Make sure you change the folder permissions of the wordpress folder to 777 to make it work with the UNIT run-user.
On the production build, the permissions are set during the build phase.

The local dev version will setup the NGINX Unit container as well as a new MariaDB Container for you using docker-compose.

Start your local environment:
`` ./run-local.sh dev``

## Using Environment-Variables
It is never a good idea or practise to store sensitive credentials inside your repository. Let's use an example to make it clear:
Set the database connection information for your wordpress site using environment variables.

Environent variables can be set
 - While starting the container instance (https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/#set-environment-variables--e---env---env-file)
 - Using a docker-compose file (https://docs.docker.com/compose/environment-variables/)
 - Using the NGINX Unit config or the NGINX Unit API to specify them.
 
Example of NGINX Unit configuration with environments:
NOTE: If you want to push your Unit configuration to git, do not store passwords here. Use the dynamic reconfiguration methods instead
(https://unit.nginx.org/configuration/#quick-start)


````json
  "applications": {
    "application": {
      "type": "php",
      "environment": {
        "DB_HOST": "mariadb",
        "SOMETHING": "else"
      },
      "user": "wordpress",
      "group": "wordpress",
      "options": {
        "file": "/etc/php.ini",
        "admin": {
          "upload_max_filesize": "20M"
        }
      },
    }
  }
````

To access your variables (e.g. in your wp-config.php) you can simply use something like:
````php
<?php
    /** The name of the database for WordPress */
    define('DB_NAME', isset ($_ENV['DB_NAME']) ? $_ENV['DB_NAME'] : 'database');
    
    /** MySQL database username */
    define('DB_USER',  isset ($_ENV['DB_USER']) ? $_ENV['DB_USER'] : 'user');
    
    /** MySQL database password */
    define('DB_PASSWORD', isset ($_ENV['DB_PASSWORD']) ? $_ENV['DB_PASSWORD'] : 'password');
    
    /** MySQL hostname */
    define('DB_HOST', isset ($_ENV['DB_HOST']) ? $_ENV['DB_HOST'] : 'localhost' );
````
